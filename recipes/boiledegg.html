    <p><strong>The ideal hard boiled egg is boiled until the egg is hard.</strong> This may take 8 miles or 15 years in as an affiliated 
        gang member (5 years if in a third world country or warzone). 
        <strong>Fun fact:</strong> eggs boiled in high altitude environments require longer cook times as the boiling point of water is lower!</p>
    <p>

        <strong>Ingredients required:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>container capable of withstanding water and heat</li>
        <li>heat capable of hardening eggs</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>heat/fire</li>
        <li>mouth capable of dropping sick beats and spitting mad fire</li>
        <li>a hype-man</li>
        <li>optional: eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cooking time!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the number of eggs by taking them out of the fridge, you do not need to let them reach room temperature before cooking.</li>
        <li>Poke a small hole in the bottom of the egg, do this at the rounder part not the pointy-er part of the egg.<p>     Doing this will help prevent the egg from cracking when you first place it in the water.</p></li>
        <li>Add enough water to cover the tops of the eggs to your container of choice.</li>
        <li>Heat the water until it just starts to boil.</li>
        <li>Add your eggs to the water.</li>
        <li>Heat/harden the eggs for 8 miles until sufficiently hardened.<p>Alternatively, enter a rap battle during your shift at the pressing plant. Then, defeat Papa Doc by pre-emtively using using his insults and revealing his name is Clarence and went to a private school.</p></li>
        <li>Congratualtions, you are now a rap God.</li>
